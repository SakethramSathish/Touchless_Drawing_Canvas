# ✨ Touchless Hand Drawing App using OpenCV & MediaPipe

This is a simple experimental project that explores the fascinating intersection of computer vision and human-computer interaction. Built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **Matplotlib**, this app enables touchless drawing on a virtual canvas using just the movement of your index finger tracked via webcam.

While developed as a lightweight side project with limited time and effort, it demonstrates the potential of hand-tracking technology in interactive applications. The core idea was to get hands-on experience with gesture recognition and real-time drawing logic — and to have a little fun along the way!

## 🛠️ Features

- 🎨 Draw on a virtual canvas using only your index finger  
- ✋ Start/stop drawing by pinching your fingers together or apart  
- 🌈 On-screen color selection buttons (Red, Green, Blue, Eraser)  
- 🧼 Clear canvas with a simple gesture  
- 💾 Save your final artwork with a single line of code

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- `OpenCV` – for real-time webcam video processing  
- `MediaPipe` – for precise hand landmark detection  
- `Matplotlib` – for displaying the camera feed and canvas in Jupyter Notebook

## ⚠️ Note

This was a small-scale, quick project done with limited effort and time. While it’s not optimized for production or heavy usage, it serves as a **fun proof-of-concept** for gesture-based drawing and interaction using Python.

## 📂 How to Run

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib
# Note: MediaPipe may not be compatible with Python 3.13 yet
